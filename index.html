        A paragraph about me!
      </h3>
      <p>
        I'm currently in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, diving headfirst into a full-time online course in the exciting
        realm of full-stack web development. Today marks the kickoff of a six-month journey dedicated to honing my
        coding skills. Despite being between jobs, I'm enthusiastically committed to mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        and Python as part of my journey into the world of web development. This is not just a learning experience; it's
        a proactive step towards unlocking new opportunities and expanding my expertise in the dynamic field of coding.
        I'm thrilled about the growth and possibilities that this coding journey will unfold in the coming months.
